# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is systematically applying engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
Software engineering is important in the technology because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as commerce, healthcare, entertainment and communication


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Structure Methodology - A methodology to improve code readability, reliability and efficiency by emphasizing clear, logical control structures like loops and conditionals.
Object Oriented Programming - Introduced concepts like classes, objects, inheritance and polymorphism. This allowed developers to model softwares more closely to real world entities, promoting reuse, scalability, and easier maintenance of codes.
Agile methodology- Introduced iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability to change.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirement Analysis - In this phase, the project's objective, scope and requirements are gathered and analyzed.
Design - This is the phase where the software blueprint is created.
Implementation/Coding - The developers write the actual code based on the design specification.
Testing - During this phase, the developers test and debug the software if it has issues.
Deployment - Once the software passes the testing phase, it is then deployed to a production environment where it is available to users.
Maintenance - This ensures the software is fuctional and relevant throughout it's lifetime.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer designs and develops the software, writes the code, debugs, reviews the code again then ensures it's well maintained.
A quality assurance engineer is in charge of testing,test automation, bug tracking, quality assuarance planning and further improvement of the software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is crafting questions or instructions that ensures you get the best response from AI assistants.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

"Tell me about taking picures" - Is a vague prompt.
"Give me a step by step guid on how I can take pictures using Canon 7D camera during on a sunny morning" - This is more effective because it is very clear and the instructions are very specific to what the user needs.
